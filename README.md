Heart Disease Classification Project

A classification project for determining whether a person has a heart problem
using data such as: max heart rate, age, cholesterol levels, etc...
The project is divided into 2 parts, part 1 is about non linear models
such as Random Forest, XGBoost, etc...
part 2 is about neural networks. In the end, the two are compared and 
there is a conclusion there too.

Tech used: Matplotlib  Seaborn  pandas  NumPy  TensorFlow  scikit-learn  XGBoost  CatBoost  LightGBM

Extra Stuff:
I really enjoyed working on this project, it can be improved by handling the misbalance better, or finding
a better atchitecture for the neural network, there are a lot of things that can improve the project in general,
but I wanted to cover the basics here and focus on tuning which is something that I didn't pay a lot of 
attention to.

Hope you liked the project!
